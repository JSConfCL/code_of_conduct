# Privacy Policy

JSConf Chile takes your privacy seriously. To better protect your privacy, JSConf Chile provides this privacy policy notice that explains how your personal information is collected and used.

- We respect your privacy, we always have, and we always will.
- We will never, under any circumstances, disclose individual information; we always provide aggregated information in our analyses. This makes it impossible to know your individual opinion or perspective.
- We assure you that we will never sell your data: we never have, and we never will.
- We do not send SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have chosen to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from such correspondence.

## What data we collect and why

We collect the data that allows us to do our analytical work to detect behavioral patterns in order to understand organizational culture and remote work culture.

In practice, the data we collect (and explicitly some we do not collect) are as follows:

**Identity and access**
To interact with our products and participate in our studies, we normally ask for your name and email address. This allows us to identify you so that you can access your information and our products; it also allows us to send you payment documents, updates, or other essential information.

Email communication: Here's an important note: We do not send SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have chosen to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from such correspondence.

**Billing information**
When you pay for one of our products, we will ask for billing information. This allows us to generate and send you an invoice. We do not currently use an internal payment system for credit or debit cards, instead relying on third-party services such as Stripe, Mercadopago, and Webpay.

**Geolocation**
We log all your access to our products via your IP address to verify that there are no unauthorized logins. We retain these access logs for as long as your account is active.

We log the IP address you use to create an account in our products. We retain these records indefinitely because we use them to mitigate spam registrations.

Web analytics — described below in Web Interaction — is also tied to the IP address to help us troubleshoot issues and improve our strategy.

**Web Interaction**
When your browser visits our marketing pages, products, or applications, your browser automatically shares certain information, such as which operating system and browser version you're using. We track that information, along with the page you visit, the page load time, and which web service referred you to us, for statistical purposes such as conversion rate and to test new designs. This analytics data is linked to your IP address and user data if applicable, and you are registered for our services.

We use third-party applications for web analytics, specifically Google Analytics. In the future, we aim to remove this service to have a better analytics system since Google uses this information for its own products.

**Anti-bot**
We use CAPTCHA in our applications to mitigate brute force access attempts and SPAM.

**Cookies and Do Not Track**
We use "persistent first-party cookies" to save preferences and make it easier for you to access our applications. A "cookie" is a text file stored by your browser to help remember your login data, preferences, and more. You can adjust how long cookies are stored in your browser. To learn more about cookies, including how to see which cookies are being used, how they are managed, and how to delete them, please visit allaboutcookies.org.

**Correspondence and Voluntary Data**
When you write to us with a question and request help, we save that conversation, including the email address, so we have the history of past conversations to refer to if necessary in the future.

We also store any information you provide voluntarily, such as surveys and forms. Sometimes we conduct interviews with our customers, and we may ask for permission to record the conversation for future reference. We only do this with your express consent.

**Data Provided in Consulting Framework**
You may participate as an employee of one of our clients and be invited to participate in a study with us. If this is the case, we always encourage voluntary participation, while informing about the minimum number of responses required to achieve adequate reliability in sample sizes.

Whenever you participate in one of our studies, your responses will always be private, and we will never share specific data, responses, or results related to you as an individual with any third party (including your employer). We respect your privacy, we always have, and we always will.

Our analyses, conclusions, and results in relation to studies on organizational culture have always been and will always be at an aggregated level. In these studies, we seek to understand group behavior.

**Again**

- We respect your privacy, we always have, and we always will.
- We will never, under any circumstances, disclose individual information; we always provide aggregated information in our analyses. This makes it impossible to know your individual opinion or perspective.
- We assure you that we will never sell your data: we never have, and we never will.
- We do not send SPAM; we never have, and we never will. We do not send commercial emails unless you have chosen to receive them, and you will always have the option to unsubscribe from such correspondence.

## When we access your information and when we share it

Our default practice is not to access your information. The only times we access your information are to:

Provide the product or services you requested. We use third-party services to operate our applications, and this data is linked to these third-party services. This means we use technological services to access and query your data (of course, it's not printed on paper and stored in file cabinets). These processes do not involve any human access to your data, unless an error occurs in our automated processes, and we need to manually fix something. In the rare cases this happens, we work to identify the root cause to prevent it from happening again.

**Solving a Problem**
To help resolve issues related to our products or services. If at any point we need to access your user account data for support purposes.

**Misuse of Our Products or Services**
To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding misuse of our products or services. We access your data when we are investigating potential abuse, and this is a measure of last resort.

We have an obligation to protect the privacy and security of our customers and those who report issues to us. We do our best to balance both responsibilities. If we discover that you are using our products or services in an abusive manner or have violated our code of conduct, we may report the incident to the relevant authorities if necessary.

## Your Rights

We recognize and respect your rights.

**Right to know.** You have the right to know what information is collected, used, shared, or sold. In this policy, we outline the data we collect, as well as how it is used (or not used).

**Right to access.** This includes your right to access the personal information we collect about you, and your right to obtain information about how it is shared, stored, secured, and processed.

**Right to correct.** You have the right to correct your personal information.

**Right to delete / “right to be forgotten".** It is your right to request that your personal information be deleted from our possession and, by extension, from all our service providers. Fulfilling some data deletion requests may prevent you from using our products and services as our applications may no longer function for you. In such cases, a request for data deletion may result in the closure of your account.

**Right to complain.** You have the right to file a complaint about the handling of your personal information with the relevant supervisory authority.

**Right to restrict the processing of your information.** You have the right to request the restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed, including the option to not sell your personal information. (Again: we have never sold and will never sell your data)

**Right to object.** You have the right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.

**Right to portability.** You have the right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.

**Right not to be subject to automated decision-making.** You have the right to object to and prevent any decision that may have a legal effect, or similarly significant effect, on you being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for the performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable law, or is based on your explicit consent.

**Right to non-discrimination.** You have the right not to face any form of discrimination. We do not charge you a different amount to use our products, nor will we offer different discounts, nor will we provide a lower level of customer service because you have exercised your data privacy rights. However, exercising certain rights (such as the right to "be forgotten") may prevent you from using our Services.

## How we secure your data

All data is encrypted via SSL/TLS when transmitted from our server to your browser. The backup database is also encrypted.

**Deleting data**
In many of our applications, you will have the option to delete your data. The data you choose to delete will be discarded and will not be accessible by you or us. In general, your data will be inaccessible from the moment you decide to delete it. We are committed to deleting your data from our servers within 30 days of your request.

**Data location**
Our products and web applications operate in Chile. However, data storage is digital and is based on servers in the United States through Cloudflare, Digital Ocean, and Amazon Web Services.

## Changes and Questions

We may update this policy as necessary to comply with major regulations and to reflect any new practices regarding protecting your privacy. Changes to the policy will be updated in this same location, and in the future, you will be able to see these changes on GitHub.
