### The shortest version of all

Have you ever seen, that after some events, everyone ends up talking about "that person" who caused one or more attendees a hard time? Don't be that person :)

### The not so short version

In all the events run by Javascript Chile (JSConf, TechSchool, Conferences, etc), as well as in any of the social network platforms (Facebook, Slack, Discord, Twitter, etc) we seek to create a space, and an experience, free of harassment.

Our motto is that everyone is welcome, regardless of gender, race, sexual orientation, disabilities, physical appearance and/or beliefs.

***We do not tolerate harassment in any way, form or context, directly or indirectly***. Any participant who violates these rules will be sanctioned and expelled from this and future events.

### The longest version

#### What do we mean by harassment?

Any Physical and/or verbal abuse related to a person's gender, sexual orientation, disabilities, gender, physical appearance, level of knowledge, race and/or religious beliefs. Additionally, creation and/or reproduction of images of sexual content in public spaces, physical and/or verbal intimidation, stalking, rude interruptions of chats and/or inappropriate physical contact.

The organization reserves the right to request that any behavior related to the above that is seen during an event be stopped immediately by the person(s) who carry it out. Additionally, those who violate this code of conduct may be expelled from this and future events.

If you are a victim of or witness to any form of harassment, any of the listed above or others, please contact a member of the organization immediately. Those in charge of the event will be presented at the beginning of each event, and easily identifiable.

If necessary, the organization will help contact law enforcement authorities and/or provide any assistance needed to remedy the situation.
